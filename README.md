# RetroAuditLogs

Here's a retro style "look busy" Powershell script that actually does something.

Prerequisites:
Microsoft365 Subscription

Windows Terminal

After running the script and logging in with a Microsoft365 account that has appropriate permissions, the script will continually pull down logs from the Compliance Center and display them onscreen.

This script specifies how to give Windows Terminal an Apple II retro look and allows you to specify how fast or slow the text appears on the screen.
None of the retro styling is required for the script to do it's basic job however.

For the retro look I used, you'll need the Apple II "Print Char 21" font from : https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/apple2.shtml
And you'll need to add these changes to you Windows Terminal settings.json file which are specified in the script.
